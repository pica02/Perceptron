The Perceptron is a fundamental binary classification algorithm in the field of machine learning. This project implements a simple Perceptron in Python for text classification.

Key Features:

Text Classification: The Perceptron can be trained to distinguish between texts discussing sports-related topics and non-sports-related topics. This makes it useful for quickly identifying the content of texts in various contexts.

Ease of Use: The implementation is straightforward and easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners to learn about the Perceptron algorithm and its application in text classification tasks.

Customization: Users can easily customize the training data and experiment with different text preprocessing techniques to improve classification accuracy.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the provided Python script to train and test the Perceptron on your own dataset or use the sample dataset provided.
Evaluate the performance of the Perceptron and fine-tune parameters as needed.
