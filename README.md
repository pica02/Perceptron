# Perceptron
University Project for University of Siena

C++ project developed for university purposes.

This is my first project that I buildt together with my colleague of university and is like the base of Machine Learning, it's name is 'Perceptron' and he trains on some data that are given to him in input by the main function, based on those dates he can say if the text's topics are sportive or non-sportive.

Developed by Gabriele Pica & Loris Caputo.
